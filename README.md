# Directory Scanning NestJS Project

A NestJS-based project for scanning directories and their subdirectories in parallel using worker threads. This project demonstrates how to efficiently scan large directory structures while leveraging multi-core CPUs for improved performance.

---

## Features

- **Parallel Directory Scanning**: Utilizes worker threads to scan directories in parallel, ensuring optimal performance.
- **Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Supports both DFS and BFS approaches for directory traversal.
- **Worker Pool**: Uses `workerpool` to manage a pool of worker threads for concurrent scanning.
- **File Metadata**: Retrieves metadata for each file/directory, including:
  - File name
  - File path
  - File size
  - Last modified time
  - Whether it's a file or directory

---

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or higher)
- [NestJS CLI](https://docs.nestjs.com/cli/overview) (optional but recommended)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) or [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (package manager)

## Installation

1\. Clone the repository:

2\. Install dependencies:

3\. Build the project:

---

## Usage

### Running the Project

1\. Start the NestJS application:

2\. The application will start a server on `http://localhost:3000`.

---

### Scanning a Directory

To scan a directory, send a POST request to the `/scan` endpoint with the directory path in the request body.

#### Example Request

```bash

curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/scan

Â  -H "Content-Type: application/json"

Â  -d '{

Â  Â  "dirPath": "test-dir"

Â  }'

```

#### Example Response

```json
[
  {
    "file": "file1.txt",

    "filePath": "test-dir/file1.txt",

    "size": 1024,

    "modifiedTime": "2023-10-01T12:34:56.000Z",

    "isDirectory": false,

    "isFile": true
  },

  {
    "file": "dir1",

    "filePath": "test-dir/dir1",

    "size": 4096,

    "modifiedTime": "2023-10-01T12:34:56.000Z",

    "isDirectory": true,

    "isFile": false
  }
]
```

---

### Configuration

You can configure the worker pool settings in the `ScanService` class:

```typescript
this.pool = workerpool.pool(join(__dirname, 'scan-worker'), {
  maxWorkers: 5, // Adjust the number of workers
});
```
